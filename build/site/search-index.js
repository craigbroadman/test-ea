Approval vs assessment Technology choices Status: Accepted Deciders: Matthew Collyer, Craig Broadman, Mike Kocher, Wayne Ennis, Rob Wetzel, Ben Blewett, Dirk VanderBent Date: 2022-08-31 As an Enterprise Architecture function we should have visibility of architecture reviews taking place across product teams.

Request Project teams should initiate the review process by submitting a request using the Architecture Review Form Emails will be sent automatically to the relevant solution architects, and a review card created in their team channel where they can log their findings Discovery If necessary, the solution architects should liaise with the team requesting the review to understand the proposed solution Review The solution architects should review the proposal and complete the review card indicating the number of low, medium, high, and critical findings, and attaching any relevant documentation Publish Findings On completion of the review card, the project team will be notified by email Action The project team should review the findings and take the appropriate action(s) When should the team request a review Unfortunately it is not possible to provide an exhaustive set of circumstances in a which a development team should seek an architecture review. As a guide however, if the change is a defect fix or a small change to some business logic then an architecture review is probably not required. If it is a new service, a new technology, a new design pattern, a new integration, a significant refactoring, or a complex piece of business logic (especially if it crosses multiple data domains), then an architecture review probably is required. An architecture review should be considering whether a proposed design is in line with iPipeline patterns (as defined by the architecture community as a whole) and whether there is already an existing solution that could be reused. In addition, solution architects should also consider any product specific standards, over and above those specified by the community, and how well these have been followed. Feedback should be left in the way of findings, classified as low, medium, high or critical depending on their severity. A review can have multiple findings. Although some discretion will be needed when determining a findings severity, you can use the below examples as a guide. Table 1. Classification of Findings Category Definitions Low EA-L01 - The proposed solution uses a different version of a technology than in the documented best practice EA-L02 - The proposed solution uses a technology or design pattern for which there is no standard (note this is a call to action for the architecture community to address the missing standard) Medium EA-M01 - The proposed solution uses a design pattern which deviates from the documented best practice in a minor way EA-M02 - The proposed solution uses a technology or design pattern in a way that deviates from existing use cases EA-M03 - The proposed solution uses a technology or design pattern which deviates from a general interim practice High EA-H01 - The proposed solution uses a design pattern which deviates from the documented best practice in a material way EA-H02 - The proposed solution uses a new technology or design pattern which should be discussed with the architecture community before being put into use EA-H03 - The proposed solution could have relevance to other iPipeline teams but is not designed to be reusable EA-H04 - The proposed solution incurs questionable cost EA-H05 - The proposed solution would benefit by maturing an existing process Critical EA-C01 - There is already an existing solution that could be reused/adapted to meet the requirement EA-C02 - The proposed solution uses a technology or design pattern which is wholly different to the documented best practice EA-C03 - The proposed solution creates a critical security vulnerability EA-C04 - The proposed solution incurs sizable questionable cost If an architecture review assigned to you is outside your area of expertise, or you are unsure if the proposed design aligns with best practice, you have the option to escalate the review to the enterprise architecture team.

All are required in order for a sprint zero to proceed and be accepted by the project delivery team. Not including any of the below in the abstract.adoc and/or abstract.xml in this same directory will cause the request to enter immediate blocked status and require additional meeting(s) to be scheduled with architects and the product team to establish the missing information. The architectural design meeting to ascertain the following requirements should have membership from the following: Product team requesting the account Architecture team Product delivery team - ideally the person to be assigned the sprint zero. This person is there to ensure all of the below is brought up as part of the meeting(s) before a sprint zero is handed off to the product delivery team. Account name See architecture documentation for nomenclature, convention has changed. (standards/nomenclature/aws/accounts.adoc) Please supply, even if standard, as delays to check on naming conventions occur if not provided, as all below. As of 2022.01 - all first level accounts to now be named -dev, not -sbx or -sandbox. Account alias See architecture documentation for nomenclature. No longer same as account name. (standards/nomenclature/aws/accounts.adoc) To decide during architecture meeting with product/architecture/project delivery teams. Please supply, even if standard. Account email alias See architecture documentation for nomenclature. (standards/nomenclature/aws/accouts.adoc) To decide during architecture meeting with product/architecture/project delivery teams. Please supply, even if standard. FYI - most engineers don’t have O365 Exchange admin access to self-service this change and must request this change out. GitHub repo name Typically 'product-terraform' Please supply, even if standard. Adding to an existing repo or starting a new repo? FYI - engineers also can’t self service this and must submit a request to ~git-admins Check if the repo exists already and has live Terraform already present. This will require more work to understand the current state, and what needs to be done to utilize the repo for new accounts. Control Tower OU In addition to noting the OU to use, please indicate if the OU already exists and just enrolling the account(s) into it, or is this also a new OU itself, which needs to be created and have guardrails applied to it. Creating a new OU to use is a more involved and time consuming process. RFC until standard change - any accounts, not just prod. Process to work through with Chris Deegan and/or Jacob Sloan for implementing. Country for account - typically USA, GBR, or CAN. Please supply. Helps for answering 'regions' item standard starting point below, if not provided. Will be used for CountryCode tagging throughout account(s). Region(s) Typically 1 region, 'us-east-1' for USA, 'eu-west-2' for GBR, 'ca-central-1' for CAN. How many? If also creating DR region, need to supply that region as well. Provide all regions used and their order; i.e., primary/secondary. Please supply, even if standard, as we have multi-region accounts, EU accounts, etc. VPCs Starting point is 0 VPCs, unless decided they are needed during architecture design meetings. How many? To be supplied on the architecture diagram. May be multiple, or none if serverless account. If VPCs = 0, items #8 - 10 are not needed. Subnets/AZs Standard is 6 subnets, across 2 subnets. 2 public a/b, 2 private a/b, 2 data a/b. If VPCs = 0, then number of subnets provisioned will also = 0 AZs will be in alpha order for number of subnets unless otherwise provided. 2 subnets will be a and b, 3 subnets a, b, and c. Call out specific AZ requirements, if known. Some AWS resources are only supported in certain AZs. Some RDS types Workspaces IP address ranges Standard was previously /24 per subnet, recently becoming a 'how many do you need request' each time. Per subnet above the amount of IP addresses required. Starting point to use, but still confirm during architectural design session: VPCs - 10.x.x.x/26 Subnets 10.x.x.x/28 CIDRs Based on the VPC/subnet/ranges items above, what are the calculated CIDRs to use in provisioning for all resources requested? VPC = 10.1.1.1/26 etc. Full detail version of previous item. Subnet public a = 10.x.x.x/x Subnet private a = 10.x.x.x/x Etc. Create dev_role group? Typically done for starting a new product family in AWS and whatever account is created first, usually a new dev account. If yes, who needs to be members of the group? Question for product team to provide as part of request. Product team will need to provide dev_role group members as part of request, if the type of account requires an initial dev_role group to be created. 'Make it like this other account' type requests Not enough detail to work with. This will need lots of items cleared up. We typically use the same repo for dev/qa/uat/prod accounts, but not always. But are we adding to an existing repo? Differences between accounts? For example, a UK version of US account or vice versa. Still the same amount of VPCs, naming, what regions, etc. Safest and most clear and direct way is to answer all previous questions regardless of whether an account is being duplicated or not. If this is requested, all items on in this document should be confirmed during the architecture meeting, which will still be required for any new account request to ensure correct details are gathered. Aviatrix required? If any VPCs are provisioned, this is required. Otherwise, this is not needed. Transit Gateway required? Same as Aviatrix. If VPCs are provisioned, Transit Gateway will be required. Do not deploy this change without an RFC. Must be done during change windows for all environments. TGW/Aviatrix setup custom rules required? Only provide cloudsink.net for CrowdStrike, show below, as a starting point. Ask up front if anything else outgoing is needed during the architecture design meetings. How to install packages, pull updates, etc.? Would require pre-baked images for all cases / internal resources to pull all requirements, updates, managed regularly with new updates, etc. What teams responsible for managing/troubleshooting/identifying what’s needed to be whitelisted? Pull requests required for team to submit changes to whitelist. Direct Connect required? Currently will need to work heavily with network team to accomplish this, and much of the work is manual and not yet incorporated into Terraform processes. Internal Data Center DNS resolvers needed? If direct connect = yes, yes/no for needing DNS resolvers for internal data center resources. N/A if no vpc & direct connect. Transit Subnets required and their CIDRs? Always a /28 per subnet. Range to request with the rest of the subnets. Create deploy account yes/no? Shared management account no longer permitted for CodePipeline. Must have a dedicated deployment account for the specific product family of accounts. Financial approval cleared? Confirm during design/architectural that meeting financial approval has happened. No accounts should be created without the budget being cleared. R&D Owner/Product Owner should be informing Mike Prendergast of the budget and have the cost calculator be completed.","title":"AWS Account Setup (Requirements)","component":"EnterpriseArchitectureWiki","version":"1","name":"aws_account_setup.requirements","url":"/EnterpriseArchitectureWiki/1/aws_account_setup/aws_account_setup.requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"Sprint zero requirements to establish as part of design","hash":"_sprint_zero_requirements_to_establish_as_part_of_design","id":1},{"text":"General notes","hash":"_general_notes","id":2},{"text":"Requirements","hash":"_requirements","id":3}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"Table of Contents summary nomenclature route tables vpc [egress] vpc [workload] this document describes the aws network firewall implementation model that is to be used as the reference and baseline for any aws account which have resources in them that require internet access a given network firewall object shall be named with the same name as the vpc it is in, with a two digit index suffix a given firewall policy shall have the same name as the firewall for which it is used a given rule group shall have a name which expresses its function a given nat gateway shall have the same name as the vpc it is in, with a two digit index suffix, followed by the availability zone a given internet gateway shall have the same name as the vpc it is in, with a two digit index suffix for examples, see the architecture diagram each availability zone shall have its own set of route tables. a given route table shall have the same name as the subnet with which it is associated. default route is network firewall interface endpoint default route is nat gateway in public subnet default route is internet gateway in egress vpc default route is transit gateway attachment.","title":"AWS Network Firewall (Guidelines)","component":"EnterpriseArchitectureWiki","version":"1","name":"aws_network_firewall.guidelines","url":"/EnterpriseArchitectureWiki/1/aws_network_firewall/aws_network_firewall.guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"summary","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"nomenclature","hash":"_nomenclature","id":2},{"text":"route tables","hash":"_route_tables","id":3},{"text":"vpc [egress]","hash":"_vpc_egress","id":4},{"text":"transit subnet","hash":"_transit_subnet","id":5},{"text":"firewall subnet","hash":"_firewall_subnet","id":6},{"text":"public subnet","hash":"_public_subnet","id":7},{"text":"vpc [workload]","hash":"_vpc_workload","id":8},{"text":"workload subnet","hash":"_workload_subnet","id":9}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Table of Contents summary: frequency: retention: ransomware: AWS Backup is used to store snap shots of the backup drives (currently mssql only) follows the iPipeline standard for backup frequency follows the iPipeline standard for data rentention component backups are copied to the data-backup-bcp-usa account to provide resiliency","title":"AWS Backup Reference (Documentation)","component":"EnterpriseArchitectureWiki","version":"1","name":"aws_backup_ransomware","url":"/EnterpriseArchitectureWiki/1/database/aws_backup_ransomware.html","titles":[{"text":"summary:","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"frequency:","hash":"_frequency","id":2},{"text":"retention:","hash":"_retention","id":3},{"text":"ransomware:","hash":"_ransomware","id":4}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"Table of Contents ℹ Use of AWS CodePipeline across iPipeline should be documented and understood Context and Problem Statement Decision Drivers Decision Outcome Status: Accepted Deciders: Craig Broadman, Michael Kocher, Wayne Ennis Date: 2022-11-01 CodePipeline is used across iPipeline but in many different ways and without much visibility across the organisation.

CodePipeline automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change, based on the release model you define. This enables you to rapidly and reliably deliver features and updates. You can easily integrate AWS CodePipeline with third-party services such as GitHub or with your own custom plugin. With AWS CodePipeline, you only pay for what you use. There are no upfront fees or long-term commitments. 🔗 AWS CodePipeline Craig Broadman Michael Kocher Wayne Ennis Jonathan Yan Tri Le Chris Blackwell Emeric Quervet Luke Steele Ryan Lenahan Jason Brown TBC Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment via web hooks that detect code changes in source control branches (typically master / main) Gated approvals for promotion to sensitive / higher environments (e.g. uat / prod) to ensure only approved changes are promoted Linear environment deployments, for example e.g. dev ➡ qa ➡ uat ➡ prod Parallel builds Roll forward deployments rather than rollback Visual representation of what deployment version is in each environment (Jenkins and Octopus are much better at this) Non-linear environment deployments It’s not possible to choose a version other than the latest changed version to promote Database Deployments (Dirk to elaborate) Rollbacks This is the default option and is recommended by AWS. A pipeline is kicked-off whenever a change in the configured pipeline source branch is detected. This is the perfect choice when fully implementing Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment. At time of writing, CodePipeline supports sourcing from AWS CodeCommit, GitHub (mandated by iPipeline), Amazon ECR, and Amazon S3. ℹ When using GitHub as the source for a pipeline, CodePipeline uses a webhook to detect changes in a remote branch and kicks off the pipeline. ℹ When using CodeCommit, Amazon ECR, or Amazon S3 as the source for a pipeline, CodePipeline uses an Amazon CloudWatch Event to detect changes in the source and immediately kick off a pipeline This option does not work well for gated approvals if you want to choose to promote anything other than the latest set of changes to higher environments. Why? CodePipeline is designed for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment through linear environments. Therefore if you merge frequently but don’t complete the whole CodePipeline through to every environment each time (e.g. you use gated approvals), it’ll create several instances of the pipeline execution (although this seems to be limited to two) each of which need to be approved. You then lose the ability to choose which one to promote to the next environment, it will just run the pipeline twice. At the time of writing we’re not sure if this is latest -1 followed by latest or first followed by latest but either way it causes complications. To illustrate the problem, imagine the following scenario: * CodePipeline is setup to automatically deploy to qa on a merge to master * Gated approvals are enabled for uat and prod * Change 1 is merged to master, it’s automatically deployed to qa, tested and signed off * Change 2 is merged to master, it’s automatically deployed to qa, tested and signed off * Change 3 is merged to master, it’s automatically deployed to qa, tested and signed off * Change 4 is merged to master, it’s automatically deployed to qa but is not yet tested/signed off If you now navigate to the CodePipeline in the AWS console, you don’t see 4 instances (one for each change) you see just one (the latest). Therefore if you now wish to promote to uat, you must take Change 4 (the latest). However for some reason you actually need to approve it twice?? Why use this option? Rerelease current source artifacts/repositories Multiple source artifacts/repositories where the following conditions are true It is not ideal to trigger a release on each individual source’s change No single source artifact/repository change is ideal to trigger the pipeline How to with CodeStarSourceConnection GitHub actions - Set the configuration parameter 'DetectChanges' to 'false' as noted in the AWS CodePipeline User Guide This is located in the CodePipeline JSON document structure, at the following JPath location .pipeline.stages[].actions[].configuration.DetectChanges How to use with Amazon S3 source actions - Set the configuration parameter 'PollForSourceChanges' to 'false' as noted in the AWS CodePipeline User Guide This is located in the CodePipeline JSON document structure, at the following JPath location .pipeline.stages[].actions[].configuration.PollForSourceChanges 🚫 Both actions types above must explicitly set to 'false' in order to prevent automated release triggering. Why use this option? * There are hundreds of events that can trigger a GitHub Action Workflow ** For example you could invoke a GitHub Action upon the creation of a release in GitHub * You therefore have a huge degree of flexibility of when/how to invoke CodePipeline 🚫 Do not use this option to deploy code changes to higher environments without going through dev/qa first! How? * Obtain an AWS role with the correct permissions (TBD) to execute CodePipeline. * Get the access-key / secret key and add them to GitHub secrets * Create a GitHub action, based on your trigger point(s) and hook it up to call JavaScript code to start the CodePipeline execution (as per the below): var AWS = require(\"aws-sdk\"); var core = require(\"@actions/core\"); try { var awsRegion = core.getInput(\"aws-region\"); var awsAccessKey = core.getInput(\"aws-access-key\"); var awssecretKey = core.getInput(\"aws-secret-key\"); var pipelineName = core.getInput(\"pipeline-name\"); AWS.config = new AWS.Config(); AWS.config.region = awsRegion; AWS.config.accessKeyId = awsAccessKey; AWS.config.secretAccessKey = awssecretKey; var codepipeline = new AWS.CodePipeline(); var pipeline = { name: pipelineName, }; codepipeline.startPipelineExecution(pipeline, function (err, okData) { if (err) { console.log(err, err.stack); } else { console.log(okData); } }); } catch (error) { core.setFailed(error.message); } The code above was taken from this third party AWS CodePipeline GitHub Action - Feel free to use this as a reference point but DO NOT USE THIS ACTION DIRECTLY. A proof of concept to test/demonstrate this functionality has not yet been written Why use this option? * You could use change detection to trigger deployments to your dev / qa environments * And then use a GitHub Action to invoke deployments to sensitive / higher environments (such as uat / prod) We suggest using this approach when you want all changes to the master / main branch to be automatically deployed / tested in your development/QA environments but want control of when to promote to more sensitive environments. How? * Create two pipelines: One for dev / QA, triggered on change detection on the master / main branch One for promotion to sensitive environments, triggered by a GitHub Action You can configure CodePipeline to be kicked off on a scheduled basis (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly etc) ⚠ Although CodePipeline supports beginning pipeline executions based on periodic checks, this is a pattern not recommended by AWS. CodePipeline supports custom actions and manual approvals by introducing a custom CloudWatch event that can call a Lambda function to determine which CodePipeline(s) to trigger; this has the following benefits: Avoid reacting to unimportant files: Avoid triggering a pipeline when changing files that do not affect the application functionality (e.g. documentation files, readme files, and .gitignore files). Conditionally kickoff pipelines based on environmental conditions: Use custom code to evaluate whether a pipeline should be triggered. This allows for further customization beyond polling a source repository or relying on a push event. For example, you could create custom logic to automatically reschedule deployments on holidays to the next available workday. 🔗 See Code Pipeline Custom Logic for more info Database servers are generally one-time creations Database servers minor updates are automatically applied AWS can force upgrades when your version is no longer supported Code Pipeline is not aware of any of the above making it difficult to safely deploy If terraform detects a change that forces a destroy and rebuild and Code Pipeline commits the change the environment will be lost which will result in a blank database unless it was previously built from a snapshot When using Code Pipeline have separate pipelines for database deployments If a separate pipeline is not an option use terraform to logically separate files and use a yaml file to control Code Pipeline Table 1.

This guide recommends naming conventions for the file name and the symbol name. ✅ Do follow a pattern that describes the symbol’s feature then its type. The recommended pattern is feature.type.adoc ✅ Do make file and directory names lowercase ✅ Do name files and files to clearly convey their intent ✅ Do use only standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names. ❌ Don’t use generic page names such as document1.html. Why? Naming conventions help provide a consistent way to find content at a glance. Consistency within the project is vital. Consistency with a team is important. Consistency across a company provides tremendous efficiency. Why? Nnaming conventions help find desired code faster and make it easier to understand. Why? Names of folders and files should clearly convey their intent. For example, templates/architecture_decision_record.template.adoc` should contain a template for architecture decision records. ✅ Do use underscores, not dashes (hyphens) to separate words, for example, design_guide.template.adoc. Why? Grammatically, hyphens are for hyphenating words. using them for other things introduces potential ambiguity. Also, visually, underscores more closely represent the whitespace they’re replacing. ✅ Do use consistent names for all assets named after what they represent. ✅ Do give the filename the conventional suffix representing it’s symbol (such as .template.adoc, .adr.adoc, .guidelines.adoc, .standard.adoc) for a file of that type. Why? Consistent conventions make it easy to quickly identify and reference assets of different types. We have chosen to adopt as flat a folder structure as possible to make things easier to find. Make folder names lowercase. Use underscores, not hyphens, to separate words, for example, health_check. Use only standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names. If you’re adding to a directory where everything else already uses underscores, and it’s not feasible to change everything to underscores, it’s okay to use hyphens to stay consistent. For example, if the directory already has lesson_1.jd, lesson_2.jd, and lesson_3.jd, it’s okay to add your new file as lesson_4.jd instead of lesson-4.jd. However, in all other situations, use hyphens. ✅ Recommended: avoiding_cliches.jd ✅ Sometimes OK: avoiding-cliches.jd ❌ Not recommended: avoidingcliches.jd ❌ Not recommended: avoidingCliches.jd ❌ Not recommended: avoiding_clichés.jd Other exceptions It’s okay to have some inconsistency in filenames if it can’t otherwise be avoided. For example, sometimes tools that generate reference documentation produce filenames based on different style requirements or based on the design and naming conventions of the product or API itself. In those cases, it’s okay to make exceptions for those files.","title":"Naming Files and Folders (Guidelines)","component":"EnterpriseArchitectureWiki","version":"1","name":"naming_files_and_folders.guidelines","url":"/EnterpriseArchitectureWiki/1/documentation/naming_files_and_folders.guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"General Guidelines","hash":"_general_guidelines","id":1},{"text":"Separate words in file names with underscores","hash":"_separate_words_in_file_names_with_underscores","id":2},{"text":"Symbols and filenames","hash":"_symbols_and_filenames","id":3},{"text":"Use a flat folder structure","hash":"_use_a_flat_folder_structure","id":4},{"text":"Exceptions for consistency","hash":"_exceptions_for_consistency","id":5}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Table of Contents line interactive or better [preferable online or better] network card preferred manufacturers? must be current generation of product line other not standby/offline can be double conversion or delta conversion online supports ssh supports https supports snmp v3 external temperature sensor network authentication [ldap, radius, etc] remote logging apc eaton vertiv [liebert] e.g. apc smt or smx, not sum, srt, etc same for network monitoring card must have remotely controlled switched outlets validated by dave/josh prior to po submission pdu environment conditions need to be evaluated for pdu selection should be accompanied with appropriate pdus [network connected/switched outlets] minimum, ups needs to have switched outlets","title":"UPS (Standards)","component":"EnterpriseArchitectureWiki","version":"1","name":"ups.standard","url":"/EnterpriseArchitectureWiki/1/environment/ups.standard.html","titles":[{"text":"line interactive or better [preferable online or better]","hash":"_line_interactive_or_better_preferable_online_or_better","id":1},{"text":"network card","hash":"_network_card","id":2},{"text":"preferred manufacturers?","hash":"_preferred_manufacturers","id":3},{"text":"must be current generation of product line","hash":"_must_be_current_generation_of_product_line","id":4},{"text":"other","hash":"_other","id":5}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"Table of Contents ℹ To make it easier for us to monitor the health of our applications and services we should define a health check specification Context and Problem Statement Considered Options Decision Outcome Positive Consequences Status: Accepted Deciders: ???

How to start using ADRs How to start using ADRs with tools ADR file name conventions Suggestions for writing good ADRs Teamwork advice Useful resources Doc Writer An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences. An architecture decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement. An architecture decision log (ADL) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization). An architecturally-significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture. All these are within the topic of architecture knowledge management (AKM). The goal of this document is to provide a fast overview of ADRs, how to create them, and where to look for more information. Abbreviations: AD: architecture decision ADL: architecture decision log ADR: architecture decision record AKM: architecture knowledge management ASR: architecturally-significant requirement To start using ADRs, talk with your teammates about these areas. Decision identification: How urgent and how important is the AD? Does it have to be made now, or can it wait until more is known? Both personal and collective experience, as well as recognized design methods and practices, can assist with decision identification. Ideally maintain a decision todo list that complements the product todo list. Decision making: A number of decision making techniques exists, both general ones and software architecture specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping. Group decision making is an active research topic. Decision enactment and enforcement: ADs are used in software design; hence they have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, develop, and operate it. Architecturally evident coding styles and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices. ADs also have to be (re-)considered when modernizing a software system in software evolution. Decision sharing (optional): Many ADs recur across projects. Hence, experiences with past decisions, both good and bad, can be valuable reusable assets when employing an explicit knowledge management strategy. Group decision making is an active research topic. Decision documentation: Many templates and tools for decision capturing exist. See agile communities, e.g. M. Nygard’s ADRs. See traditional software engineering and architecture design processes, e.g. table layouts suggested by IBM UMF and by Tyree and Akerman from CapitalOne. Decision guidance: The steps above are adopted from the Wikipedia entry on [Architectural Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) A number of decision making techniques exists, both general ones and software architecture specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping. You can start using ADRs with tools any way you want. For example: If you like using Google Drive and online editing, then you can create a Google Doc, or Google Sheet. If you like use source code version control, such as git, then you can create a file for each ADR. If you like using project planning tools, such as Atlassian Jira, then you can use the tool’s planning tracker. If you like using wikis, such as MediaWiki, then you can create an ADR wiki. Our file name convention: The name has a present tense imperative verb phrase. This helps readability and matches our commit message format. The name uses lowercase and dashes (same as this repo). This is a balance of readability and system usability. The extension is adoc (same as this repo). This can be useful for easy formatting. Characteristics of a good ADR: Rational: Explain the reasons for doing the particular AD. This can include the context (see below), pros and cons of various potential choices, feature comparions, cost/benefit discussions, and more. Specific: Each ADR should be about one AD, not multiple ADs. Timestamps: Identify when each item in the ADR is written. This is especially important for aspects that may change over time, such as costs, schedules, scaling, and the like. Immutable: Don’t alter existing information in an ADR. Instead, amend the ADR by adding new information. Characteristics of a good \"Context\" section in an ADR: Explain your organization’s situation and business priorities. Include rationale and considerations based on social and skills makeups of your teams. Include pros and cons that are relevant, and describe them in terms that align with your needs and goals. Characteristics of good \"Consequences\" section in an ADR: Explain what follows from making the decision. This can include the effects, outcomes, outputs, follow ups, and more. Include information about any subsequent ADRs. It’s relatively common for one ADR to trigger the need for more ADRs, such as when one ADR makes a big overarching choice, which in turn creates needs for more smaller decisions. Include any after-action review processes. It’s typical for teams to review each ADR one month later, to compare the ADR information with what’s happened in actual practice, in order to learn and grow. A new ADR may take the place of a previous ADR: When an AD is made that replaces or invalidates a previous ADR, then a new ADR should be created An ADR is an opportunity to lead your teammates, by talking together about the \"why\", rather than mandating the \"what\". For example, decision records are a way for teams to think smarter and communicate better; decision records are not valuable if they’re just an after-the-fact forced paperwork requirement. Some teams much prefer the name \"decisions\" over the abbreviation \"ADRs\". When some teams use the directory name \"decisions\", then it’s as if a light bulb turns on, and the team starts putting more information into the directory, such as vendor decisions, planning decisions, scheduling decisions, etc. All of these kinds of information can use the same template. We hypothesize that people learn faster with words (\"decisions\") over abbreviations (\"ADRs\"), and people are more motivated to write work-in-progress docs when the word \"record\" is removed, and also some developers and some managers dislike the word \"architecture\". In theory, immutability is ideal. In practice, mutability has worked better for our teams. We insert the new info the existing ADR, with a date stamp, and a note that the info arrived after the decision. This kind of approach leads to a \"living document\" that we all can update. Typical updates are when we get information thanks to new teammates, or new offerings, or real-world results of our usages, or after-the-fact third-party changes such as vendor capabilties, pricing plans, license agreements, etc. Introduction: [Architectural decision (wikipedia.org)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) [Architecturally significant requirements

Application - Any application internal or external supported by Ipipeline Organization Ipipeline needs a common set of practices for authenticating support/technical staff into Ipipeline Applications. We’d like to eliminate the use of shared user credentials, and promote the practice of using a common user store for our internal staff. Eliminate The use of shared credentials Multiple credentials for a single staff member Promote The practice of using a centralized user store for our internal staff which facilitates Implementing current (and future) authentication requirements (i.e. password strength, complexity, MFA, etc) Modifying/Revoking privileges as staff members leave or change roles We have instances where staff authenticates into the application itself with elevated privileges that unlocks admin features. These admin features are usually hidden to the customer. The privileged users may be stored in an internal Database, or a centralized user store (Ping). Individual staff members may have their own set of credentials, or there may be a set of credentials shared between internal staff. Instead of logging into the same application as the end user. We have cases where internal staff logs into a separate admin panel to support customer facing applications. This admin panel contains all the features necessary to support, and configure the applications our customers interact with. The privileged users may be stored in an internal Database, or a centralized user store (Ping). Individual staff members may have their own set of credentials, or there may be a set of credentials shared between internal staff. Internal staff may need access to the underlying infrastructure for support purposes. This could mean running queries on a database, or accessing logs on a server. The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines on how staff members should authenticate into an Ipipeline Application for support purposes. It does not cover authentication mechanisms for application infrastructure nor does it cover how an Ipipeline Application should be supported. Ancillary role not recognized within the Ipipeline Application It is not recommended that all support users have access to OKTA’s administrative features. There should be a designated administrator from the support team to facilitate the access to applications and records. Members of the support team or staff members expected to support application in an environment. Users in this role should have the most elevated privileges. In production the support role should be assumed by members of the support team. Staff members outside of the support team may assume this role in lower environments. Example - A Developer may need access to the features of support role in QA to troubleshoot and test functionality Ipipeline employee not on the support team, but requires certain access to support an Ipipeline application. Ability to accept Ipipeline internal roles passed in from OKTA via SAML or SCIM Provides appropriate access based on the roles passed Ability for Support roles to add access controls to specific records Allow Developer roles to access records based on access controls Require users in the support role to revoke access based on time constraint User Store for Ipipeline Staff Group Users based on Role Ability to Authenticate user and Redirect to appropriate application via SAML Ability to pass Ipipeline internal roles to Ipipeline application via SAML or SCIM Allow delegated group member administrators (possibly users in support role) to grant access to Ipipeline applications, and specific records Support team receives ticket support team member goes to application to troubleshoot case support team member identifies record in question and begins troubleshooting Support team member does not find root cause of issues, and needs more support support team member contacts their designated OKTA group Administrator Support team’s designated OKTA Administrator notes the Case number and the developer needed to further troubleshoot Support team’s designated OKTA Administrator gives developer access to the application and assigns the developer the case Adds Custom header (ipipeline-case-access) to the developer’s user account in OKTA with the value being the case number Developer uses OKTA to sign into the Application Ipipeline Application Accepts authentication request looking for custom Access header (ipipeline-case-access) Ipipeline Application reads value of custom access header (ipipeline-case-access), and authorizes the developer to view the record Developer finishes troubleshooting case Support team’s designated OKTA Administrator revokes developer’s permissions to the application and the case, by removing custom access header Please note that the ultimate goal is to have automatic revocation of access. please see Open Requirements for further details Automatic Revocation of Access - We are currently looking into mechanisms that would help automatically revoke access to applications/records based on time constraints.
